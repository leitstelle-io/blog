# When will the game be finished?
Development is actively underway, but since I'm not working on it around the clock and there are still some things to clarify, I unfortunately cannot provide a specific date. My goal is to present you with something playable within the next one to two years. I know it requires patience, but I'm doing my best to create a great game for you. Thank you for being so patient and accompanying me on this adventure!
