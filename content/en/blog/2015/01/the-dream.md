# A Personal Firefighting Game?
A few years ago, the dream of developing my own firefighting game started within me. The captivating world of `Emergency 1-4,` `Feuerwache.net,` `LstSim.de,` and most recently, `Leitstellenspiel.de,` fueled my enthusiasm for firefighting and gaming.

These games intensified my long-standing desire to create a realistic firefighting experience. Now is the time when I warmly invite you to be part of this exciting journey and witness firsthand how my vision becomes a reality.

With years of experience in software development and active participation in `Leitstellenspiel,` I am now ready to launch the project `leitstelle.io.` I also had the privilege of developing an extension called `LSS-Manager`, which has been used by over 20,000 players and is still actively used by several thousand players today.

With this background, the first cornerstone is laid to share my passion with you and embark on this journey. Keeping you regularly updated on the development and walking this exciting path together is of utmost importance to me. Together, we will create the firefighting game we've always dreamed of. Let's ignite the spark of enthusiasm and create something great together. Join me as dreams turn into reality!
