# Idea → Domain

As can be easily seen, several years have passed between the conception and the current time. Every project requires thorough consideration and planning before it can even be initiated. Additionally, ideas often exist only on paper and may never be put into action.

Nevertheless, the original idea has evolved, and I have decided to acquire a domain. This, in a way, represents the initial step for all my projects and can now even be considered a kind of hobby. Originally, this endeavor had a domain long before the actual idea, but for various reasons, I had sold the planned address `firefighters.io`. Right after the sale, I couldn't resist the temptation to search for an adequate replacement. After hours of research, I came across the domain `leitstelle.io`.

The selection of the domain now officially marks the beginning of this project. It invites you to participate in this journey—whether as a co-developer, potential player, or simply as someone who shares the passion for firefighting and games.
