# Short break – but It's not over!

Since December 2024, I’ve been on an entirely new professional path: after my time as a Senior Software Engineer, I’ve taken on a new challenge as a firefighter. My training in this field starts on March 17, 2025, and will last until July 25, 2025.

This intensive period will require my full attention, which means I will be temporarily pausing the project. But don’t worry – this is not a goodbye message, just a brief break! The project is very dear to me, and I’m excited to continue working on it with renewed energy after my training.

During this time, I’ll still be active on the [forum](https://forum.leitstelle.io) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/cdRq3bztJu). I encourage you to share your ideas, discuss new features, or simply chat about firefighting topics. The community is a central part, and I’m looking forward to staying in touch with all of you during my training.

This break also gives me the opportunity to gather new inspirations and insights from my training, which may later be incorporated into the project. I’m curious to see what new perspectives will emerge!

So, stay tuned, join the discussions, and let’s shape the future together. Thank you for your support – I’m looking forward to everything that’s to come!

See you soon, and best regards!
