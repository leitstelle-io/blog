# More Individuality for the Discord Community! ✨
I recently introduced new roles on our Discord server, giving you the opportunity to specify your geographical location. This feature allows you to quickly connect with like-minded individuals from the same state or region. At the same time, it helps me ask more targeted questions specifically related to your state or region.

With individual notification settings, you can precisely define which messages you want to receive. This way, you stay informed without unnecessary distractions.

Additionally, you now have the option to indicate your membership in specific BOS (Authorities and Organizations with Security Tasks) that you belong to.

You can conveniently manage your roles by visiting `#Browse Channels`. This allows you to make your participation on our server even more individualized and leverage the information that is most relevant to you.
