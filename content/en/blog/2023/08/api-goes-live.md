# First API Goes Live Today üåç
Right from the start of the project, I've been working on the backend to create the foundation of the API and the overall game architecture. With the goal of quickly presenting results, the API is now live.

At this point, it's possible to view all existing `Stations` and retrieve details for an individual `Station` (where a Station refers to a firefighting station). While this is just the beginning, it represents a significant first step.

You can check out the API at the following link: [https://alpha.api.leitstelle.io/api/stations](https://alpha.api.leitstelle.io/api/stations)
