# The Blog in New Splendor

The website now boasts a new blog! Current news will not only be published on Discord but also directly on the website. This enables everyone to stay updated on the latest developments outside of Discord.

Despite this expansion, the Discord server will continue to be the hub for discussions and the exchange of ideas. I aim to provide diverse communication channels to ensure that everyone stays informed and can actively participate.
