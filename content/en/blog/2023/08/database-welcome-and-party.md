# Database Switch, Warm Welcome, and Village Festival

Yesterday, I updated the database layer (no more MySQL) and will soon deploy this improvement on the Alpha Server. An important step to advance the project and provide a solid foundation—no one likes long loading times, right?

Before diving into details, I want to highlight our annual village festival taking place from today until Sunday. The fire department is hosting the festival, so there will be a bit of a lull in terms of major updates this weekend.

A warm welcome to all newcomers in our community! I appreciate your interest and participation. Despite the festival, I am available in the chat for any questions and discussions.
