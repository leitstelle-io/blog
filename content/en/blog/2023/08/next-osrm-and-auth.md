# Next: OSRM and Authentication
My upcoming steps involve creating a Proof of Concept (POC), where I will initially test routing and real-time vehicle display in both the backend and frontend.

To achieve this goal, I plan to implement OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine) and simultaneously work on a solution for vehicle simulation. I will leverage OSRM and explore various approaches to vehicle simulation to achieve the best possible results.

Additionally, I am preparing the frontend by incorporating login and registration features. This will enable me to seamlessly shift the POC there and provide the entire functionality of the project for a comprehensive evaluation. I am excited to see how these advancements will impact the project and look forward to optimizing both the technical implementation and user experience.
