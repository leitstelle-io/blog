# From ‚Ç¨1200 to ‚Ç¨1.50: The Map Conversion That Changed Everything! üåç

Hello everyone!

It's been almost a month since I shared the last update. In this time, there have been some challenges that have influenced my progress. Time constraints, an unfortunate encounter with illness, and several unexpected incidents disrupted my plans. But there's also good news!

Despite the adversities, I have achieved significant progress. My main focus was on converting the image-based OpenStreetMap (OSM) map into a vector-based version. This process has been automated and is now cost-effective. Instead of days of work and expensive software, I now only need 1 hour and 50 minutes to convert the entire map with each update‚Äîthis happens in a fully automated process. The vector map offers many advantages: it loads faster, flickers less, seamlessly adapts to the game's design, and is also more cost-effective to operate.

Another crucial point is that `leitstelle.io` is no longer limited to the DACH region (Germany, Austria, Switzerland) but can now represent the entire world. This was a pivotal step that, while costing a few days of work and approximately ‚Ç¨20 in trial and error, reduced conversion costs from ‚Ç¨1200 annually to just ‚Ç¨1.50 per update. There's even the potential to further lower costs through partial updates of the world map.

Next, I plan to launch the new database online and develop the logic for generating missions. Map customization takes a back seat for now as other aspects take priority.

In addition to these technical advancements, I have also contemplated hosting the project as I consolidate more projects. Scalability and costs are crucial factors to consider, as it involves more work than just solving hosting issues for the game.

Overall, the last month has been challenging but very productive. I look forward to the next steps and providing you with more updates soon. Thank you for your support!
